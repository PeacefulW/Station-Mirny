# System API

## Purpose

This document lists a minimal set of code-confirmed external surfaces for core
systems.

Its job is to answer:

- which methods are currently exposed as callable entrypoints
- which state is currently exposed for read access
- which helpers are not documented as safe entrypoints

## Scope

This pass is intentionally narrow.

It covers only the minimal core set confirmed in code during this pass:

- `EventBus`
- `TimeManager`
- `ItemRegistry`
- `SaveManager`
- `PlayerAuthority`
- `CommandExecutor`
- `BuildingSystem`
- `WorldStreamer`
- `MountainRevealRegistry`

## Out of Scope

- future API design
- undocumented systems outside the minimal pass
- private helper methods and backing dictionaries
- any contract not directly confirmed in code

## Reading Rules

- Every entry below is backed by current code.
- Underscore-prefixed methods and fields are treated as internal by current
  code convention and are not documented here as safe entrypoints.
- If a system or method is absent here, it was not confirmed in this minimal
  pass.

## Confirmed Core Surfaces

### EventBus

Owner file: `core/autoloads/event_bus.gd`

Role:
- global signal hub for cross-system communication

Confirmed public surface:
- signal declarations on the autoload singleton

Read / subscribe path:
- other systems connect to `EventBus.<signal>`

Mutation path:
- signal emission ownership is documented per event in `event_contracts.md`

Not documented here as safe entrypoints:
- direct ownership of gameplay state
- any helper methods, because none are defined on the current singleton

### TimeManager

Owner file: `core/autoloads/time_manager.gd`

Role:
- authoritative runtime time state for hour, day, season, and day phase

Confirmed readable state:

| Surface | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `balance` | variable | Loaded from `res://data/balance/time_balance.tres` |
| `current_hour` | variable | Current in-game hour as `float` |
| `current_day` | variable | Current in-game day as `int` |
| `current_season` | variable | Current season enum value |
| `current_time_of_day` | variable | Current day-phase enum value |
| `get_hour()` | method | Whole hour |
| `get_day_progress()` | method | `0.0..1.0` day progress |
| `get_sun_progress()` | method | Normalized sun progress |
| `get_sun_angle()` | method | Shadow angle in radians |
| `get_shadow_length_factor()` | method | Derived shadow-length factor |
| `is_time_paused()` | method | Pause query |
| `get_time_scale()` | method | Time scale query |

Confirmed mutation entrypoints:

| Surface | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `reset_for_new_game()` | method | Resets to default start state |
| `restore_persisted_state(hour, day, season)` | method | Save/load restore path |
| `set_paused(paused)` | method | Pause toggle |

Not documented here as safe entrypoints:
- `_calculate_speed()`
- `_apply_authoritative_time_state()`
- `_advance_time()`
- direct writes to the public `current_*` fields

Current code note:
- the code-confirmed state-transition paths that also emit sync events are the
  documented mutation methods above plus internal helpers

- all `_load_*` helpers

### SaveManager

Owner file: `core/autoloads/save_manager.gd`

Role:
- orchestration facade for save/load scenarios

Confirmed readable state:

| Surface | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `current_slot` | variable | Current save slot name |
| `is_busy` | variable | Save/load busy flag |
| `get_save_list()` | method | Returns `Array[Dictionary]` |
| `save_exists(slot_name: String)` | method | Checks `meta.json` presence |
| `consume_pending_load_slot()` | method | Returns and clears pending slot |

| `request_load_after_scene_change(slot_name: String)` | method | Stores pending slot |
| `clear_pending_load_request()` | method | Clears pending slot |

Not documented here as safe entrypoints:
- `_resolve_slot_name()`
- direct calls into `SaveCollectors`, `SaveAppliers`, or `SaveIO` when the
  orchestration surface is sufficient

### PlayerAuthority

Owner file: `core/autoloads/player_authority.gd`

Role:
- single lookup point for the local player and player list

Confirmed read entrypoints:

| Surface | Return | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `get_local_player()` | `Player` | May return `null` |
| `get_all_players()` | `Array[Player]` | Current code scans group `player` |
| `get_local_player_position()` | `Vector2` | Returns `Vector2.ZERO` if unavailable |

Confirmed mutation / maintenance entrypoints:

| Surface | Notes |
|---|---|
| `clear_cache()` | Clears cached local-player reference |

Not documented here as safe entrypoints:
- direct `get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("player")[0]` lookups in new code

Normalization confirmed in code:
- inserts `success: false` if missing

Not documented here as safe entrypoints:
- reliance on command result fields that are not documented in `commands.md`

### BuildingSystem

Role:
- facade for building placement, removal, room recalculation, and persistence

Confirmed readable entrypoints:

| Surface | Return | Notes |

| `place_selected_building_at(world_pos: Vector2)` | Attempts placement and returns a result dictionary |
| `remove_building_at(world_pos: Vector2)` | Attempts removal and returns a result dictionary |

Current code note:
- `_execute_place_command()` and `_execute_remove_command()` prefer
  `CommandExecutor.execute(...)` when a `command_executor` group member exists,
  and fall back to direct method calls when it does not

Not documented here as safe entrypoints:
- `_execute_place_command()`
- `_execute_remove_command()`
- `_create_building_from_persistence()`
- `_clear_buildings_for_persistence()`
- `_walls`

Role:
- V0 world runtime orchestrator and current `chunk_manager` compatibility surface

Confirmed readable entrypoints:

| Surface | Return | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `get_world_seed()` | `int` | Current deterministic world seed |
| `get_world_version()` | `int` | Current canonical world version |

| `get_mountain_reveal_registry()` | `MountainRevealRegistry` | Returns the world-domain owner of reveal alpha state |
| `is_walkable_at_world(world_pos: Vector2)` | `bool` | Reads `base + diff`; returns `false` while a chunk is not ready |
| `has_resource_at_world(world_pos: Vector2)` | `bool` | Diggable surface query for the current harvest path; mountain targets must have at least one exposed 4-neighbor face |
| `get_mountain_visibility_sample(tile_coord: Vector2i)` | `Dictionary` | Debug/read surface for current mountain visibility state (`mountain_id`, `cavity_component_id`, `opening_id`, `visible_opening`, `cover_open`, `inside_outside_state`) |

Confirmed mutation entrypoints:

| Surface | Notes |
|---|---|
| `reset_for_new_game(seed, version)` | Clears runtime state and emits `world_initialized` |
| `load_world_state(data: Dictionary)` | Restores `world_seed` / `world_version` plus save-local `worldgen_settings.mountains`, then clears runtime state |
| `load_chunk_diffs(entries: Array)` | Loads serialized chunk diffs into `WorldDiffStore` |

Not documented here as safe entrypoints:
- `_streaming_tick()`
- `_worker_loop()`
- direct access to `_chunk_packets`, `_chunk_views`, or `_diff_store`
- direct mutation of native packet dictionaries outside the documented methods
- mutation of dictionaries returned by `get_chunk_packet()`

### MountainRevealRegistry

Owner file: `core/systems/world/mountain_reveal_registry.gd`

Role:
- single writer for runtime-only per-`mountain_id` roof alpha and reveal /
  conceal lifecycle

Confirmed readable entrypoints:

| Surface | Return | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `get_alpha(mountain_id: int)` | `float` | Returns current roof alpha in `0.0..1.0`; defaults to `1.0` for unknown mountains |

Confirmed mutation entrypoints:

| Surface | Notes |
|---|---|
| `request_reveal(mountain_id: int)` | Flips the target roof alpha for one mountain to `0.0` |
| `request_conceal(mountain_id: int)` | Starts debounce and later flips the target roof alpha for one mountain to `1.0` |
| `reset_state()` | Clears transient alpha / target / debounce state on new game or load |

Current consumer note:
- current code exposes this owner through `WorldStreamer.get_mountain_reveal_registry()` for world-domain consumers only; `MountainResolver` itself remains player-local and is not a documented external read surface
- alpha animation applies to the current per-mountain cover mask state owned by `ChunkView`; visible openings still come from entrance-derived roof holes rather than from the alpha tween itself

Not documented here as safe entrypoints:
- `_alpha_by_mountain`
- `_target_by_mountain`
- `_conceal_delay_by_mountain`
- `_tick()`
